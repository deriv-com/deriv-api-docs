#### Deriv account

If you don't have a Deriv account yet, you can easily create one by visiting our signup page or using the <Link href="/api-explorer#new_account_virtual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_virtual</Link> API call. It's completely free. And if you have an account already, please log in using your account details. To avoid any accidental loss of funds during testing, we recommend using your demo account instead of a real account.

To earn markup, get a Deriv real account to receive your monthly earnings. You can also create a real account using <Link href="/api-explorer#new_account_real" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_real</Link> or <Link href="/api-explorer#new_account_maltainvest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_maltainvest</Link> API calls.

To create Deriv applications, you'll need an API token with the Admin scope for the account you wish to use for your application.
